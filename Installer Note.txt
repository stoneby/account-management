Installation
As an example, I use InnoSetup for just about all of my installs now which looks like this:

; IE 11 mode
Root: HKCU; Subkey: "Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION"; ValueType: dword; ValueName: "MarkdownMonster.exe"; ValueData: "11001"; Flags: createvalueifdoesntexist

Other installer products will also let you install keys directly.
